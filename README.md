# Codecademy - Mysterious Organism

Solution to a codecademy intermediate challenge called Mysterious Organism.

## Project Goals

Context: You’re part of a research team that has found a new mysterious organism at the bottom of the ocean near hydrothermal vents. Your team names the organism, Pila aequor (P. aequor), and finds that it is only comprised of 15 DNA bases. The small DNA samples and frequency at which it mutates due to the hydrothermal vents make P. aequor an interesting specimen to study. However, P. aequor cannot survive above sea level and locating P. aequor in the deep sea is difficult and expensive. Your job is to create objects that simulate the DNA of P. aequor for your research team to study.

## Starter Helper Functions

`returnRandBase()` and `mockUpStrand()`

DNA is comprised of four bases (Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine, and Guanine). When `returnRandBase()` is called, it will randomly select a base and return the base ('A','T','C', or 'G').

`mockUpStrand()` is used to generate an array containing 15 bases to represent a single DNA strand with 15 bases.
